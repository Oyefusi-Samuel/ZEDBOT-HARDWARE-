[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findvisual_marker.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "visual_marker", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "visual_marker"
  with any of the following names:

    visual_markerConfig.cmake
    visual_marker-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "visual_marker" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "visual_marker_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "visual_marker" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
